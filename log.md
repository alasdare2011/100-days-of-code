# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1st, 2018.

**Today's Progress**: I've only recently started coding and have been taking a course on Unity and C# on Udemy. Today I worked on enemy and player behaviors in a 2D space shooter game, adding explosion effects on death. 

**Thoughts:** Things went really well today, with no issues or compiler errors on my first attempt to add effects on object destruction. Both player and enemy ships explode into small stardust when health is <=0.

### Day 2: January 2nd, 2018.

**Today's Progress**: Continuing to work on my code for my Udemy course. I created a formation spawner for enemy ships that respawns enemies once they are killed. 

**Thoughts:** Mostly working as intended, but I need to figure out how to alter the time between enemy respawns. As of now, as soon as the formation is destroyed, enemies pop back in one at a time, in order. I would like to figure out a way to shuffle them around and also randomize the spawn timing a bit more.

### Day 3: January 3rd, 2018.

**Today's Progress**: Today was a really good day for learning and practicing. I spent most of my lunch break reading the C# Yellow Book to expand my C# knowledge a bit. During my drives to work, the gym, and home, I listened to the CodeNewbie podcast to try to immerse myself in as much programmer talk as possible. Once I got home, I continued to progress through [Bob Tabor's C# Fundamentals for Absolute Beginners](https://mva.microsoft.com/en-us/training-courses/c-fundamentals-for-absolute-beginners-16169) course, which I'm really enjoying for learning the basics of C# and Visual Studio. 

*But wait*--I did actually still manage to find time to code today! I broke off of my Udemy coursework and decided to begin working on my own text-based RPG/adventure game in Unity. I only began by creating the very basics of the game, but I have working game states and keyboard commands that transition between scenes. 

I plan to take this code and expand it dramatically; I would eventually like to flesh out the story, add items, enemies, and a few combat scenes in the game. The story that is in place now is simply a placeholder to test the game systems and get them working. Eventually--when I'm more comfortable with both C# and Unity--I would like to add a graphical interface and turn this into a 2D RPG/adventure game. But, I'm pleased with the progress of simply getting things to work for now.

Whew...long entry today. Without further ado, the code for my basic placeholder story-based RPG/adventure game can be found below!

**Thoughts:** Really pleased with my productivity today. I didn't create/code anything mind-blowing, but it *worked*, which is a huge step in the right direction for a newbie such as myself. I am really starting to immerse myself into as many coding resources as possible, including books, podcasts, and communities. I'm really loving where this is going!

### Day 4: January 4th, 2018.

**Today's Progress**: Today was a snow day, so no work! That means more time to code! I started the day reading a bit more of [Rob Miles' C# Yellow Book](http://www.csharpcourse.com/) and finishing up [Bob Tabor's awesome C# Fundamentals for Absolute Beginners](https://mva.microsoft.com/en-us/training-courses/c-fundamentals-for-absolute-beginners-16169) course. After that work, I went on to coding by myself.

So, I decided to start taking the training wheels off and be a bit more ambitious today. I have really enjoyed the Udemy Unity coursework I've done so far, but I'm taking a brief break from it to take what I've learned and try to apply it to my own projects outside of the course. Since I decided yesterday that I'd like to expand my very basic text/story-based RPG, I made an effort to create a class template for two character classes. Nothing much to show in terms of display within the game, but this is more of the background stuff that will be running in Unity to power the characters. 

**Thoughts:** Another productive day today! I don't have much to show for my work, but I do have a few scripts I'm happy with. Tomorrow I will plug away at this a little more, and maybe come up with a way to display this in the start screen (e.g., selecting your class and displaying their starting attributes/skills).

### Day : January 45th, 2018.

**Today's Progress**: Another snow day, another code day! I decided to jump back into my Udemy C#/Unity coursework and continue to work on my space shooter, Star Swarm. I did a lot of the work without the assistance of the videos/instructors and updated/cleaned up some of my older scripts. I added a music player that starts up when you load the game, loops, and destroys any additional music players that are spawned when the player is taken back to the start screen. I also added sound effects to my player and enemy ships, both for firing lasers and for when they are destroyed. Additionally, I added a UI score overlay, and created a function to increase the player's score by 150 points for each enemy destroyed.

**Thoughts:** All in all, another pretty productive day. I didn't create or code a lot of new products, but I updated, cleaned up, and improved some of my older scripts, all on my own! I think that was the biggest achievement for me today: not needing the videos or instructions to improve the scripts. I know I can still improve a *ton* from here, but I feel like I'm making baby steps each day.
