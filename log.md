# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1st, 2018.

**Today's Progress**: I've only recently started coding and have been taking a course on Unity and C# on Udemy. Today I worked on enemy and player behaviors in a 2D space shooter game, adding explosion effects on death. 

**Thoughts:** Things went really well today, with no issues or compiler errors on my first attempt to add effects on object destruction. Both player and enemy ships explode into small stardust when health is <=0.

### Day 2: January 2nd, 2018.

**Today's Progress**: Continuing to work on my code for my Udemy course. I created a formation spawner for enemy ships that respawns enemies once they are killed. 

**Thoughts:** Mostly working as intended, but I need to figure out how to alter the time between enemy respawns. As of now, as soon as the formation is destroyed, enemies pop back in one at a time, in order. I would like to figure out a way to shuffle them around and also randomize the spawn timing a bit more.

### Day 3: January 4th, 2018.

**Today's Progress**: Today was a really good day for learning and practicing. I spent most of my lunch break reading the C# Yellow Book to expand my C# knowledge a bit. During my drives to work, the gym, and home, I listened to the CodeNewbie podcast to try to immerse myself in as much programmer talk as possible. Once I got home, I continued to progress through [Bob Tabor's C# Fundamentals for Absolute Beginners](https://mva.microsoft.com/en-us/training-courses/c-fundamentals-for-absolute-beginners-16169) course, which I'm really enjoying for learning the basics of C# and Visual Studio. 

But wait--I did actually still manage to find time to code today! I broke off of my Udemy coursework and decided to begin working on my own text-based RPG/adventure game in Unity. I only began by creating the very basics of the game, but I have working game states and button commands that transition between scenes. I plan to take this code and expand it dramatically; I would eventually like to flesh out the story, add items, enemies, and a few combat scenes in the game. The story that is in place now is simply a placeholder to test the game systems and get them working. Eventually--when I'm more comfortable with both C# and Unity--I would like to add a graphical interface and turn this into a 2D RPG/adventure game. But, I'm pleased with the progress of simply getting things to work for now.

Whew...long entry today. Without further ado, the code for my basic placeholder story-based RPG/adventure game can be found below!

**Thoughts:** Really pleased with my productivity today. I didn't create/code anything mind-blowing, but it *worked*, which is a huge step in the right direction for a newbie such as myself. I am really starting to immerse myself into as many coding resources as possible, including books, podcasts, and communities. I'm really loving where this is going!
