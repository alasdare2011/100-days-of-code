# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1st, 2018.

**Today's Progress**: I've only recently started coding and have been taking a course on Unity and C# on Udemy. Today I worked on enemy and player behaviors in a 2D space shooter game, adding explosion effects on death. 

**Thoughts:** Things went really well today, with no issues or compiler errors on my first attempt to add effects on object destruction. Both player and enemy ships explode into small stardust when health is <=0.

### Day 2: January 2nd, 2018.

**Today's Progress**: Continuing to work on my code for my Udemy course. I created a formation spawner for enemy ships that respawns enemies once they are killed. 

**Thoughts:** Mostly working as intended, but I need to figure out how to alter the time between enemy respawns. As of now, as soon as the formation is destroyed, enemies pop back in one at a time, in order. I would like to figure out a way to shuffle them around and also randomize the spawn timing a bit more.
