# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1st, 2018.

**Today's Progress**: I've only recently started coding and have been taking a course on Unity and C# on Udemy. Today I worked on enemy and player behaviors in a 2D space shooter game, adding explosion effects on death. 

**Thoughts:** Things went really well today, with no issues or compiler errors on my first attempt to add effects on object destruction. Both player and enemy ships explode into small stardust when health is <=0.
